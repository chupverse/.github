The [University Hospital of Poitiers (CHUP)](https://www.chu-poitiers.fr) is a public health establishment in the Vienne department in France. In conjunction with the Poitiers University, the CHUP combines care, research and innovation. The *chupverse* reposetory includes R packages for analyses of health data. It also includes examples of calculations of the required sample sizes, presentations proposed in the data science seminars, or LaTex templates.

## Some R packages
* The library [survivalPLANN](https://github.com/chupverse/survivalPLANN) contains a variety of functions to construct a super learner in the presence of censored times-to-event and to evaluate its prognostic capacities.
* The library [survivalSL](https://github.com/chupverse/survivalSL) allows the estimation of a survival neural network and the related predcitions from new datasets. The Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Networks (PLANN) are implemented, as proposed by Biganzoli et al. (1998). 

## Estimation of sample sizes
* The repository [sample-size](https://github.com/chupverse/sample-size) page is devoted to the calculation of the number of patients required for several studies such as an randomized clinical trial (RCT) for causal inference or a cohort for constructing or validating a predictive tool. R codes are proposed. We can click [here](https://poitiers-health-data.shinyapps.io/SampleSize/) to access to the related R-shiny website for an user-friendly interface.

## Presentations performed during the data science seminars
* The repository [slides-of-seminars](https://github.com/chupverse/slides-of-seminars)  contains the slides of the invited speakers.

## LaTex templates
* [Beamer presentation](https://github.com/chupverse/beamer-presentation)
* [Latex article](https://github.com/chupverse/latex-article)
