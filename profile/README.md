The [University Hospital of Poitiers (CHUP)](https://www.chu-poitiers.fr) is a public health establishment in the Vienne department in France. In conjunction with the Poitiers University, the CHUP combines care, research and innovation. The *chupverse* reposetory includes R packages for data analyses. We also share examples for estimations of sample size, presentations of speakers in the data science seminars, and $\(La)TeX$ templates.

## <img src="https://github.com/chupverse/.github/blob/main/profile/logoR.png" width="25"> packages
* [survivalPLANN](https://github.com/chupverse/survivalPLANN) allows the estimation of a survival neural network and the related predcitions from new datasets. The Partial Logistic Artificial Neural Networks (PLANN) are implemented.
* [survivalSL](https://github.com/chupverse/survivalSL) contains a variety of functions to construct a super learner in the presence of censored times-to-event and to evaluate its prognostic capacities.
* [survivalNET](https://github.com/chupverse/survivalNET)  is relative to flexible model the net survival, i.e. the survival when the only cause of death is due to the disease.
* [RISCA](https://github.com/chupverse/RISCA)  proposes numerous functions for cohort-based analyses, either for prediction or causal inference. 
  
## Estimation of sample sizes
* The repository [sample-size](https://github.com/chupverse/sample-size) is devoted to the calculation of the number of patients required for several studies such as an randomized clinical trial (RCT) for causal inference or a cohort for constructing or validating predictive tools.
* Click [here](https://poitiers-health-data.shinyapps.io/SampleSize/) to access to the related R-shiny website for an user-friendly interface.

## Presentations performed during the data science seminars
* The repository [slides-of-seminars](https://github.com/chupverse/slides-of-seminars)  contains the slides of the invited speakers.

## $\(La)TeX$ templates
* An exemple of [presentation with Beamer](https://github.com/chupverse/beamer-presentation).
* An exemple of [manuscript with Latex](https://github.com/chupverse/latex-article).
